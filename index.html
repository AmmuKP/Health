                    <p id="Food">"We are what we eat."</p>
                    <p>The way we eat is very important to help us in our everyday life. We should eat in a way that is called BALANCED DIET. It includes foods that give us energy, foods that repair our body, foods that protect our body and foods that help us go to the toilet easily. This might include yucky foods like broccoli, but they are really good for you and you'll feel much happier later!</p>

                    <p>The time we eat and how we eat are also important. We should also have table manners. We should eat at the same time every day. We should also eat neatly and politely. We should eat in proportion. We should eat a lot for breakfast, a little less for lunch and very little for dinner.</p>

                <div>
                    <p id="Exercise">"Exercise is the key to not only physical fitness but also peace of mind."</p>
                    <p>The reason we exercise is for us to feel good about ourselves. We do this to feel happy and energized during our life. You don't need to go to fitness clubs to feel good. Just 10-15 minutes of proper exercise is enough. Exercise is very important during this pandemic because we're all cooped up inside our homes and we can't roam around like before. Children can't go outside and play so this is a good alternative for them. The best time to exercise is early morning, before you eat breakfast. This will make you feel energized and happy throughout the day. Mental exercise is also very important. A hour of meditation or yoga in the mornings every day is enough for you to feel refreshed and alert throughout the day.</p>

                <div>
                    <p id="Rest">"Sleep is the Golden Chain that binds Health and Our Bodies together"</p>
                    <p>Rest helps us be alert through the day. We should sleep for atleast 7-8 hours every night. Sleep early and wake up early should be your protocol. To sleep well, don't eat right before bed, don't watch TV right before bed and don't watch your phone before bed. Instead you read a book before bed and have a snuggly doll to hug while sleeping. We should sleep for enough time so that our body can recharge.</p>
